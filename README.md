# CMS_Practical-_6 - My Journey in Setting Up and Connecting Tools


**Learning Activities & Resources**


Embarking on this project, I took the initiative to set up the essential tools by creating accounts for Trello, Slack, and GitHub. Fortunately, I stumbled upon some insightful guides and videos online, which facilitated the process, enabling me to navigate through the initial setup with relative ease.

In the next phase, I focused on establishing connections between Trello, GitHub, and Slack. This step was akin to constructing a bridge that seamlessly linked these diverse platforms. The integration allowed our team to effortlessly monitor tasks and receive real-time updates on code changes within our team chat on Slack, fostering a more streamlined and efficient collaborative environment.

Moving forward, I began populating our Trello board with foundational information, outlining project goals and tasks. Simultaneously, I contributed code to our GitHub repository. This phase felt akin to laying the groundwork for a construction project, and I eagerly anticipate witnessing the project evolve further.

Here are the link of the sites that I create for the assignment 2.

**Estimated Hours**


Up to this point, I've invested around 5 hours in the setup and integration process. Despite encountering a slight learning curve initially, I'm steadily gaining proficiency. Looking ahead, I anticipate dedicating another 5-10 hours this week to finalize the organization of our project, ensuring it's fully prepared for launch.


**Content Insight**


Our Trello board functions as a visual roadmap for our project, delineating sections for tasks, ideas, and feedback. It serves as an invaluable tool to grasp the entirety of the project at a glance, fostering alignment within the team.

The GitHub repository acts as a digital library, securely housing our code files and facilitating seamless collaboration. It serves as a safeguard for our project's critical assets.

Meanwhile, Slack operates as our virtual team room—a central hub for communication, updates, and queries. Its functionality proves crucial in maintaining connectivity, particularly in a remote working setup.


**Analytics using SMART rules**


Specific: Our Trello board boasts specific tasks with explicit deadlines and designated team members.
Measurable: Progress tracking involves monitoring completed tasks and the frequency of code updates.
Achievable: Our goals are ambitious yet realistic, broken down into manageable steps.
Relevant: The selected tools align directly with our project's needs, ensuring efficiency in goal attainment.
Time-bound: Set deadlines for each project phase ensure adherence to the timeline and meeting established targets.
