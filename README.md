# CMS_Practical-_6 - My Journey in Setting Up and Connecting Tools


**Learning Activities & Resources**


Embarking on this project, I took the initiative to set up the essential tools by creating accounts for Trello, Slack, and GitHub. Fortunately, I stumbled upon some insightful guides and videos online, which facilitated the process, enabling me to navigate through the initial setup with relative ease.

In the next phase, I focused on establishing connections between Trello, GitHub, and Slack. This step was akin to constructing a bridge that seamlessly linked these diverse platforms. The integration allowed our team to effortlessly monitor tasks and receive real-time updates on code changes within our team chat on Slack, fostering a more streamlined and efficient collaborative environment.

Moving forward, I began populating our Trello board with foundational information, outlining project goals and tasks. Simultaneously, I contributed code to our GitHub repository. This phase felt akin to laying the groundwork for a construction project, and I eagerly anticipate witnessing the project evolve further.

Here are the link of the sites that I create for the assignment 2.

Github Repo: https://github.com/IsaiahWang/AcademixConnect


**Estimated Hours**


Up to this point, I've invested around 5 hours in the setup and integration process. Despite encountering a slight learning curve initially, I'm steadily gaining proficiency. Looking ahead, I anticipate dedicating another 5-10 hours this week to finalize the organization of our project, ensuring it's fully prepared for launch.


**Content Insight**


Our Trello board functions as a visual roadmap for our project, delineating sections for tasks, ideas, and feedback. It serves as an invaluable tool to grasp the entirety of the project at a glance, fostering alignment within the team.

The GitHub repository acts as a digital library, securely housing our code files and facilitating seamless collaboration. It serves as a safeguard for our project's critical assets.

Meanwhile, Slack operates as our virtual team room—a central hub for communication, updates, and queries. Its functionality proves crucial in maintaining connectivity, particularly in a remote working setup.


**Analytics using SMART rules**


Specific: Our Trello board boasts specific tasks with explicit deadlines and designated team members.
Measurable: Progress tracking involves monitoring completed tasks and the frequency of code updates.
Achievable: Our goals are ambitious yet realistic, broken down into manageable steps.
Relevant: The selected tools align directly with our project's needs, ensuring efficiency in goal attainment.
Time-bound: Set deadlines for each project phase ensure adherence to the timeline and meeting established targets.
Career/Employability/Learning Insights


This experience is proving instrumental in acquiring valuable skills related to project management, collaboration, and version control—essential competencies in the ever-evolving tech landscape. The prospect of adding these skills to my professional toolkit is genuinely exciting.


Collaborating on this project with my team is contributing significantly to my communication, problem-solving, and teamwork skills—attributes transferrable to any workplace scenario.


Adaptability is a key takeaway, with the understanding that technological landscapes continually shift. Learning to navigate new tools and workflows is not just an asset but a necessity, and this experience is honing my adaptability and versatility as a learner.


**Why I chose these websites (Trello, Slack, GitHub) instead of others?**


Trello: Its simplicity, visual appeal, and user-friendly interface make it an ideal choice for managing tasks and projects, complemented by seamless integration with other tools.
Slack: Recognized as the preferred communication tool for many tech teams, its versatility in quick chats, file sharing, and team-wide updates made it the natural choice for our project's communication needs.
GitHub: Being the industry standard for version control, GitHub's robust features for managing code, tracking changes, and collaborative coding made it an indispensable choice for our development workflow.
